<p>
From today the forecast horizon for each series depends on the series frequency.
This applies to both the forecasts and our backtesting procedure.
</p>

<h4>Horizons</h4>

<p>
These horizons are based on those used by the M4 competition.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekly (f=52): 13 weeks ahead</li>
<li>Monthly (f=12): 18 months ahead</li>
<li>Quarterly (f=4): 8 quarters ahead</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thanks</h4>
